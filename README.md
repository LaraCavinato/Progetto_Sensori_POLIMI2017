# Progetto_Sensori_POLIMI2017
Here comes the source code of an Arduino project by five of us, students of the course "Technology for sensors and clinical instrumentation" at Politecnico di Milano.
The project consists on fading a LED according to the pression of two capacitive buttons. 
Scripts are build both with Arduino IDE and Processing IDE, which include a naive graphic interface.
